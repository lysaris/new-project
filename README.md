# DANN

## New Features

### Dashboard Page
- After logging in, users now have access to a personal **Dashboard**. This page includes a to-do list widget where you can add, mark done, and remove tasks. Tasks are saved privately in your browser for each user account.

### Installable PWA & Offline Support
- The website is now a **Progressive Web App** (PWA)! You can "Install" it to your device for a native-like experience, and it will work offline. All main pages and assets are cached for fast access even without an internet connection.

### Donate Page Link
- The Donate page now features a real "Buy me a coffee" button, allowing you to support the creator directly.
